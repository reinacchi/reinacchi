# My Programming Skills

- You can say I'm a decent person at programming & coding related. I'm neither too bad nor good at it. Sometimes when I'm on a development, I would take 2-3 people who are better than me to participate. In result, I could understand more & better on how does this works.

- I'm currently on a Development at **[Reloaded](https://github.com/reloadedjs/reloaded)**, Another NodeJS Discord Library. Wanting to participate/contribute in this development are very welcomed ヾ(⌐■_■)ノ♪
